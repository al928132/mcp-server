# Midterm Project Ideas — DIG 4503

## 1. Interactive Data Visualization
Build an interactive web-based visualization of a dataset you care about (e.g., music trends, climate data, local events). Use D3.js or similar. Focus on storytelling through data design.

## 2. Generative Art Tool
Create a browser-based generative art application using p5.js or Canvas API. Allow users to tweak parameters (color, speed, density) to explore procedural visual outputs.

## 3. Augmented Reality (AR) Experience
Design a marker-based or markerless AR experience using AR.js or 8th Wall. Could be a portfolio overlay, campus tour enhancement, or art installation concept.

## 4. Accessible Digital Zine
Design and publish an interactive digital zine on a social/cultural topic. Focus on strong typography, layout, and accessibility (WCAG compliance). Could use HTML/CSS or a tool like Readymag.

## 5. AI-Assisted Creative Tool
Build a small app that uses an AI API (e.g., Claude or DALL-E) to help users generate creative content — poem illustrations, mood boards, or character designs — with a thoughtful UX.

## 6. Immersive Audio-Visual Experience
Combine Web Audio API with visuals to create a music-reactive or ambient audio experience. Could explore themes like memory, space, or nature.

## 7. Digital Preservation Project
Document and digitize a local cultural artifact, oral history, or community story. Present it as an interactive timeline or archival website.

**Notes:**
- Pick a topic you're genuinely curious about — it'll show in the work.
- Scope carefully: a focused, polished small project beats an ambitious unfinished one.
- Consider who your audience is and design for them.
